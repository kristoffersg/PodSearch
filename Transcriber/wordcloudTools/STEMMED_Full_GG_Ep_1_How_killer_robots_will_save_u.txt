hello and welcom to 7minut opinion your audio guid to thoughtprovok argument from a varieti of writer and thinker Im paul waldman economist at the week and today Id like to make the case for killer robot if there is one thing scienc fiction is tortois if that advanc in evit and robot becom selfawar then decid to rise up and destroy their human creator the scenario is no longer complet fiction weve gotten to the point where the idea of killer robot is someth we need to confront killer robot is someth we need to confront so we can decid had a hell of it and Im here to help to defend killer robot Im tell you I believ they can make the world safer and even more human place theyr just to clarifi when I say killer robot Im refer to robot note Im refer to robot militari system that can make their own decis to fire weapon are militari in those of other countri use a lot of differ kind of robot today from drone in the sky the bomb dispos battleground lost some of these have weapon onli a human be can actual fire the robot cant make the decis the robot cant make the decis to fire on it own the prospect turn over life and death decis to autonom robot system ha some peopl veri worri that the case against killer robot with simon most selfevid after all machin cant feel empathi or grappl with moral grappl with mark boundari or is it a care and concern I have a conscienc will be held account for their decis or carri the bell ani of the emot qualiti we expect from soldier who temper their work with their human and that whi Im grow number of peopl in nation are encourag the develop of some kind of bridg the develop of some kind of intern regim to restrain killer robot somewher to those that restrict the use of chemic weapon and landmin 4 year ago human right watch you should a comprehens report make the case against autonom weapon system and thi year they releas a new memo call eva intern polici prohibit their develop product in use india develop product news on the surfac doe not seem like a good idea but when we think of weapon wield robot will probabl think idea of technolog that exist today or of the apocalypt scifi vision we get from movi like the termin wa Im a domin neither of those scenario accur repres where we might find ourselv in 20 or 30 year what are offici intellig ha progress far beyond it current capabl the justif for allow robot to wield weapon is simpl human be are terribl at make are terribl at make decis anyth we fear killer robot might be capabl of do it someth we human alreadi do to one anoth human soldier becom tire inattent confus uncertain angri afraid all these thing can be the mistak includ the kill of innoc civilian kill of innoc civilian artifici intellig made still pale in comparison to human when it come to distinguish real threat from emerg one but it just a matter of time befor it catch up about gut instinct what about those emot hunch that help flash like human make calcul decis well we human have those well we would have those hundr and it stink becaus we can integr our knowledg and prior experi with all the data our sens are deliv to us at a given moment so what doe soldier see someon walk down the street with a lump under hi jacket he process all the avail inform to make a judgement about whether or not the man is a threat in the not too batman is a threat in the not too distant futur robot will be abl to process all that inform for more effect than human in the vast major of situat plu they wont get tire or scare or upset when the technolog reach that point not employ autonom weapon system will actual mean sacrif their live abov civilian write the live of civilian and soldier consid a self drive car minibus so uncomfort with linear comput drive around town but the technolog is get more sophist and it get deploy in commerci avail car increment with self park system Z support system adapt cruis control and all the while peopl are begin to warm up to the idea of head over the we are also no more awar of the central problem self drive car I meant to say which is our own danger drive it but traffic fatal have declin in recent year the number are still stagger are still stagger in 2014 more than 32000 american die in car crash onc we have a full fleet of self drive car traffic debt will probabl be a few isol case in which aerob system where will the situat or cat find it way to the decis that could have heard the tragedi and some peopl might even die as a result of rape case are someon block for those who oppos self drive car me think how aw it would be to sit in an autonom vehicl it plung you off a cliff and it the same bro case that frighten those who oppos at home brighton those who oppos autonom weapon as well thank how aw it would be if a killer robot shot someon you care about becaus it program went haywir those are inde scari thought but they ignor the equal scari altern all the peopl kill on the road and all the innoc civilian kill by the militari are due to poor human we are due to poor human decisionmak perhap well decid to accept a grade as tool to avoid even a singl death by robot becaus do so make us feel less afraid more in control it a veri human respons but that doesnt make it the right one that doe it for thi episod 78 explain from or go to the week comm audio and if you like we hear some scrap for a podcast and give us a read or
