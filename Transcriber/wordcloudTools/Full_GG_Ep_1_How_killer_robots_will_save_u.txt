hello and welcome to 7-minute opinions your audio guide to thought-provoking arguments from a variety of writers and thinkers I'm Paul Waldman economist at the week and today I'd like to make the case for killer robots
if there is one thing science fiction is tortoise if that advancements in evitable and robots become self-aware then decide to rise up and destroy their human creators the scenario is no longer completely fictional we've gotten to the point where the idea of killer robots is something we need to confront
killer robots is something we need to confront so we can decide had a hell of it and I'm here to help to defend killer robots I'm telling you I believe they can make the world safer and even more humane place they're just to clarify when I say killer robots I'm referring to robotic note
I'm referring to robotic military systems that can make their own decisions to fire weapons are military in those of other countries use a lot of different kinds of robots today from drones in the sky the bomb disposal battleground lost some of these have weapons only a human being can actually fire. The robot can't make the decision
the robot can't make the decision to fire on its own the prospective turning over life and death decisions to autonomous robotic systems has some people very worried that the case against killer robots with Simon most self-evident after all machines can't feel empathy or grapple with moral
grapple with Mark boundaries or is it a caring and concern I have a conscience will be held accountable for their decisions or carrying the bell any of the emotional qualities we expect from soldiers who temper their work with their humanity and that's why I'm growing number of people in nations are encouraging the development of some kind of
bridging the development of some kind of international regime to restrain killer robots somewhere to those that restrict the use of chemical weapons and landmines 4 years ago human Rights Watch you should a comprehensive report making the case against autonomous weapon systems and this year they released a new memo call Eva international policies prohibiting their development production in use
India development production news on the surface does not seem like a good idea but when we think of weapon wielding robots will probably thinking idea of technology that exist today or of the apocalyptic sci-fi vision we get from movies like the terminator
was I'm a Dominator neither of those scenarios accurately represent where we might find ourselves in 20 or 30 years what are official intelligence has progressed far beyond its current capabilities the justification for allowing robots to wield weapons is simple human beings are terrible at making
are terrible at making decisions anything we fear killer robots might be capable of doing it something we humans already do to one another human soldiers become tired inattentive confused uncertain angry afraid all these things can be the mistakes including the killing of Innocent civilians
Killing of Innocent civilians artificial intelligence made still pale in comparison to humans when it comes to distinguishing real threat from emergent ones but it's just a matter of time before it catches up about gut instincts what about those emotional hunches that help flashing like humans make calculated decisions well we humans have those
well we would have those hundreds and it stinks because we can integrate our knowledge and prior experiences with all the data our senses are delivering to us at a given moment so what does soldier see someone walking down the street with a lump under his jacket he's processing all the available information to make a judgement about whether or not the man is a threat in the not too
Batman is a threat in the not too distant future robots will be able to process all that information for more effectively than humans in the vast majority of situations plus they won't get tired or scared or upset when the technology reaches that point not employed autonomous weapon systems will actually mean sacrificing their lives above civilians
writing the lives of civilians and soldiers considered a self driving cars minibuses so uncomfortable with linear computer driving around town but the technology is getting more sophisticated and it's getting deployed in commercially available cars incrementally with self parking system Z
supporting systems adaptive cruise control and all the while people are beginning to warm up to the idea of heading over the we are also no more aware of the central problem self driving cars I meant to say which is our own dangerous driving it but traffic fatalities have declined in recent years the numbers are still staggering
are still staggering in 2014 more than 32000 Americans died in car crashes once we have a full fleet of self driving cars traffic debts will probably be a few isolated cases in which aerobic system
where will the situation or cat find it's way to the decision that could have heard the tragedy and some people might even died as a result of rape cases are someone blocks for those who oppose self driving cars me think how awful it would be to sit in an autonomous vehicles it plunges you off a cliff and it's the same bro cases that frighten those who oppose at home
Brighton those who oppose autonomous weapons as well thank how awful it would be if a killer robot shot someone you cared about because it's programming went haywire those are indeed scary thoughts but they ignore the equally scary alternative all the people killed on the roads and all the innocent civilians killed by the military are due to poor human
we are due to poor human decision-making perhaps we'll decide to accept a graded as tools to avoid even a single death by robot because doing so makes us feel less afraid more in control it's a very human response but that doesn't make it the right one
that does it for this episode 78 explainers from or go to the week. Comm / audio and if you like we hear some scrap for a podcast and give us a reading or review on iTunes I'm Paul Warman and thanks so much for
