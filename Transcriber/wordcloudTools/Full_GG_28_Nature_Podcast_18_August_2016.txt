this week the most comprehensive catalogue yet of human Gene variation for someone who's working and learning lessons about long dead creatures using crispr and now we can look at things genetically
things genetically to ask what are the mechanisms behind this is Paris in the fossil record not sorting through 3 million compounds to find the perfect painkiller this is the nature podcast for August the 18th 2016 and Kerry Smith and I'm Adam leave it
just before we get started with really like to hear what you think of the show and their two easy ways of doing that you can leave us a review or some stars on iTunes all you can drop us a quick line with your feedback at podcast app nature.com tell us who you are
can't tell us who you are what you do and what you think ok on with the show a few hundred million years ago fish crawled out of the water and started walking during the transition fish fins somehow morphed into the limbs feet and digits found in land vertebrates does a fossil look
debretts does a fossil that captures this moment in evolution its name is tectonic and it's a fishy thing with a thin but the bones inside that's in correspond to elbows wrists and shoulders his discoverer is Neil shubin a paleontologist and developmental biologist at the University of Chicago he's been wondering ever since you
even wondering ever since he found it how things might have turned into feet and his team is now used Everyone's Favourite Gene editing technique crispr to recreate some aspects of this shift in zebrafish his nature report a you and Callaway in conversation with Reuben how do scientists know that fish fins turned into lims in and Leanne
changing the lens in in land vertebrates to show the first record as you can see the relationship between
Emily the fossil record are particularly in rocks about 375 365 we start to see intermediate creatures between showing that this transition happened between between fins to limbs of tetrapods then we got evidence in Indiana
in Indiana what are the big questions what questions are these
the last of the series with the theme of digits fingers and toes so you training off one kind of bowl for another and one of the mistresses how did that happen how did our hands and feet come the Big Show how the weather is lost so that transition from a 2 digit is a really big unknown Trust
is a really big and no trust has been booked in the fossil record as well as to which is the subjective paper and how did you tackle this question
four digits clean and we want the jeans contacts change because we knew in my eyes that certain members of these hugs changing family are actually responsible for patterning and specifying the wrist and digits in mice and people the question is what happening at Question Time
Equestria long time I did technology change the whole new Gene editing technology such as crispr-cas new ways to permanently label cells these came into being in the loudest to ask questions which were previously impossible to do experimentally I introduce Picasso louder
crispr cas allowed us to knock out these chains and fish then the other stuff done by integrity as a graduate student is permanently marked the cells that had Hearts chain activities able to trace them from the embryo to 3 months later in a job search UK
I don't suppose you gave fish food did you do end up with us when we take her to James that have finger is true with the result that Mark the wrist
Mark the wrist and digits in mice and people actually Mark with known as the skinfold the steyne Worthing are in insertion surprise resources that should have returned a lot of what I thought of as a pill in Ibiza
letter the same set of cells are used to make our fingers and toes in Fisher actually making a Holsten wedding and in particular the phone arrives what did you think that is a paleontologist would happen
visa to different kinds of bone that are completely unrelated evolutionary later development is results challenges assumptions we always start without you
Mr showing that really what happens is easiest to 2 n points of the same developmental process and issues of a simple web for this transition likely have happened to you have an idea now the molecular changes that gave Rise potentially do something like tiktaalik yeah exactly that's beautiful I'm sure
being a dancer outline how the transition happened and now we can look at things to medically A level
tape to say but mostly kind of in in terms of medical uses are you are unique in an evolutionary biologist who's using this technique tit to ask questions about the past now able to use technology to ask questions and answer question
questions and answer questions they were previously search didn't us and crispr cas is one of those because it's a very easily used technique and it applies in that works on so many different kinds of species what you can now do is really service select the species that just answer the question
best answer the question you're interested in and then apply these technologies to it then Christine up fish fins and ending up with fingers almost tomorrow in his paper and a news and views article head over to nature.com / nature coming up later in the show the one
coming up late in the show the one in 3 million compound that can kill pain with fewer side effects than morphine plus we bring you senior sharks and erosion on Saturn's moon in the research highlights first though the most comprehensive catalogue of Gene variation in humans and how useful it already is in the clinic
the radios in the clinic medical geneticist in Boston and Women's Hospital Road Institute and Harvard medical school and one day at the end of 2014 and new patient came to see him the woman's mother had died of a rare Prion disease. Just thought the mother's disease was caused by a gene
diseases caused by a gene mutation and a daughter wanted to know if she also carried the same mutation there was a 50/50 chance she would and the condition with a death sentence working with his daughter she was tested and she was negative for the mutation just like the good news the woman wasn't come
it might be good news the woman wasn't completely relieved she had a sister and her sister didn't want to test her sister was living with the fear of the 50 50 chance that she wouldn't hear at this terrible mutation green decided to look into his patients predicament a little more he knew about a huge and
he knew about the huge new database of genetic variation that promised more detail than ever before on the mutations that appear in jeans heels only than another group of scientists have been using the database to look at the genetics of Prion disease checking which mutations were really linked the disease and which were in fact benign University
benign these investigators demonstrated that the sum of the mutations for Prion disease that we had previously fat or pathogenic were in fact red Herrings and is it turned out the mutation in this family that I was working with was one of those the patients
was one of those the patients doctors had been right and wrong the mother had died of Prion disease but it was a complete coincidence that she also had this mutation it wasn't related the mutation was not the cause after all in December 2015 just a couple of days before New Year green call the sister
New Year green call the sister in to see him and we were able to sit down with her and say you know this Sword of Damocles that you've been living under for so many years this notion that if you're carrying this mutation you're going to get this disease in your going to die from it well we can relieve you of that
we can relieve you of that concern it was rather dramatic moment to actually be able to deliver this kind of good news the reason I could get to this good news was because of the sheer size of the database and how comprehensive it is in the past of Genesis is spotted a rare
in the past of Genesis is spotted a rare mutation in a patient with a rare disease they do seem that the mutation cause the disease but when you look across enough people's jeans especially including different types of population plenty of these so-called rare mutation stop popping up all over say 10% of people in a database have a particular mutation
today's have a particular mutation well 10% of people certainly don't have a particular rare disease so this single Gene can't be causing this disease that's the kind of finding that let Robert Green reveal his good news to the sisters will come back to the prime story but first let turn to the giant database that made this result possible
made this result possible that someone loves working with extremely large datasets there's no such thing as too much data Daniel McCarthy and self-confessed data head at the Broad institute of MIT and Harvard he's also part of a group called The exome aggregation Consortium x x short for the goal
X Factor short for the goal of this project was to put together a particular type of sequencing data the record exam sequencing data when Daniel sequencing data this is what he means for the 60000 sequences in the database is 10 times larger than the previous
10 times larger than the previous biggest x home catalogue published only three years ago and 2000 times larger than the first EXO methods that were only a few years before that apparently the technology is better but partly it was crowdsourcing Daniel and his team appeal to labs around the world for their raw data to doesn't Labs donated x
two dozen eggs donated x owns the sequence is a really high res to the exact database has been available online for a couple of years now so that's number of people coming in looking at the variations typically and patient samples in nature
this week in nature the X Factor NZ release their own analysis of the dataset what they've learnt about our genes through examining the database Daniel gave me highlights of rainbow of variants and lots of them are pretty much unique
the protein coding regions of the genome separation being so overwhelmingly extremely rare in fact more than half of the variance is only once in 60000 people the other I think I'm president observation we can make is to identify genes of regions of genes that are almost completely missing genetic
almost completely missing genetic variation within the population that tells the studies of pieces of the genome that are extremely important that I just can't tolerate genetic changes that are actually affect their functions and have been identified make proteins or transcribe RNA essential cell maintenance if there
child maintenance if they're mutated the embryo really even survived that means we're definition does c a mutation in such a gene they know that it's likely to cause disease I said we'd return to the prior on story in Robert greens office that December day the news he could deliver was happy but it wont always be that way with that
but it wont always be that way with exec remember the researchers who claimed the database checking whether permutations with disease causing or not well one was a woman who has self had a Prion Gene mutation and name is Sonia van up a collaborator was her husband having people involved in a project who have a strong personal Style
strong personal stage in Dragon project for it really helped all of us to focus on what actually murdered so the fact that we were building a resource here that was not only a test of abstract scientific resource but the resource that would actually have an impact on the lives of patients and their family members is not good day when the team came to look at sun is mutation
look at Sonia's mutation 100% of people who walking around making less of the protein and they're fine
less of the protein and their fine so treating the disease by decreasing a levels of this protein doesn't seem to do any damage the study has also helped conditions like Robert give Morgan used to more people read the finding the mutation from pathogenic to benign was
benign was in one fell swoop relieving a whole category of people around the world from the fear that they would otherwise carry green and for him Daniel MacArthur both based in Boston the exact browser is available except. Broad Institute. Org that's
Institute. Org that's Brown spelt b r o a d find a paper and a news and views article with plenty more detail and plenty more data at nature.com such nature how do we stop pain not just the pain of a niggling headache but really severe
headache but really severe pain like the pain after an intensive surgery or the pain caused by cancer they are whole host of powerful painkillers available for these applications and they're all variations on one particular chemical morphine these opioids have fantastic analgesic
fantastic analgesic properties but they also have a whole host of side effects for decades there's been hope that I'm picking their pathways in the brain might help us have the good without the bad well now he may have found a new type of drug which does exactly that I called that one of the researchers p
I called that one of the researchers Peter greiner to find out what problems they were trying to avoid in the first place what the problem with all of these compounds side effects depression
that can beat to death and infection in the US there are thousands of overdose death of patience which compared to the abuse of of painkillers every every year so on the one hand is chemicals relieve pain on the other
pain on the other we have all these side effects in the brain what's actually causing these two sets of effects receptor and the to activate all kinds of excavations there are induced by by the morphine derivatives and all the
and all the morphine derivatives activate leisure centre in a way that it again switches on signal transduction in the cell in the neurone in the central nervous system and that leads to the to the analgesia to the pain killing effect of tea
to the pain pill ineffective do after your period but the same time he's so cute also lead to recruitment of another protein which is called Peter arresting and that causes most of the side effects on the morphine related come home
all the morphine related compounds we have a stimulating this receptor in these two ways one relieving pain the other causing the side effects if it's the same receptor the mu opioid receptor what can you do to get this strong pain killing effect without the problems
restaurants wondering why shouldn't we look at another recession we tried to use our information be kept on their preceptor and try to find compounds that selectively activate the two protein coupling in the two protein pathway but not
the pathway but not to be directing recruitment how did he begin to look at these well we actually we started from scratch because one of us resolve to Crystal structure of the mu opioid receptor we use the structure and try to work with the computer
try to work with the computer in order to identify compounds that might recognise this binding pocket of of the receptor to me it seems like you have the design for a lock in a door slide how many different compounds
how many different compounds did you actually end up testing actually looking at how this does act to kill pain in mice
labels and of course the next step showing energy effective painkiller detecting miles and also the compound to not be very promising in model studies inedible models day. Predictive 442
440 Dixon and also for respiratory depression he start with these 3 million hypothetical compound then eventually Whittle them down to one we surprised with the results you ended up with absolute yes we did step by step
step and every step of surprising but you're right in the end you're surprised it did everything work. So is this something that we might one day actually be able to use to treat patients from the moment
you can never be sure that was Peter greiner who's based at the University of erlangen Germany to find out more about how the team develop this compound from computer simulations to experiments with mice head over to make sure. Comm Ford slash nature where you'll find a paper plus the news and views
India's no it's time for the research highlights with Corrie lock in Boston that lives in the Arctic
as in the sharks Islands to figure out the ages of 20 animals they estimate that the shark can live for 272 400 years females don't reach sexual maturity until they are more than 100 years old this could be a concern for conservationists a species that takes so long to start reproducing could be at risk of being
producing could be at risk of being over exploited by Fisheries you can learn more about the work in the journal science Saturns largest moon Titan has fascinated astronomers because it has several features resembling those on earth such as liquid on its surface energy chemisphere
surface in a thick atmosphere now researchers have discovered Another Earth like feature erosion they looked at data from nasa's Cassini spacecraft and found evidence of liquid methane flowing through a network of deep channels in Kenyans on its way to the northern Sea Titan is the only planet our body
Titan is the only planetary body in our solar system other than earth that is known to have active erosion caused by liquid on its surface the study was published in the journal geophysical research letters turn off our weekly news Chatham
turn off hourly news chat and Richard Van noorden joins us in the studio hi Richard hello Adam so fast that we've got a very big story which might answer why we exist or rather why there's any matter left in the universe so what's actually the fundamental puzzle here yeah the riddle is
yeah the riddle is why is the universe the weekend city film with matter and not anti-matter so antimatter and matter are essentially mirror image kind of particles and if they were created in equal amounts that the birth of the Universe they would have collided and annihilator beach
delighted and annihilate to each other leaving just radiation energy well obviously we don't see that around us we see matter and not much antimatter so how did that happen how did that massive excess of Matt over Hampton matter happenings after the universe so you said they're pretty much mirror images of each other but that is this
each other but that is this asymmetry we see in the universe around us what have physicists been looking to to try to explain this a cemetery particles behave differently is that they may have found it
we have found it is only a hint because the experiment is doing this doesn't have any statistics to be sure but it looks like a neutrinos these elusive particles that all around us with a very hard to detect might be different in their matter and anti-matter forms what exactly what they looking at what was the experimental set
setting out what was the experimental setup for visiting Japan and they are shooting beams of neutrinos over an image 300 kilometres to this tank on the ground and the tank is filled with 50000 tons of water and they need all this water because they're trying to detect and Neutrino Divino there streaming
in vino that streaming for our bodies all the time as we speak but I hardly ever interact with methods to very hard to see now these neutrinos have mass shooting or of one flavour it's called neutrinos come in three flavours milntown electron and the funny thing about neutrinos is that they can oscillate but
he knows is that they can oscillate between their flavours as they travel so versatile they shot a beam of muon neutrinos and saw how they changed flavours how many electron neutrinos are they see in the other end in this tank then they did the same thing with me on anti neutrinos the antimatter version
neutrinos the antimatter version and weirdly it looks like these beans are not behaving the same way it looks like these matter and antimatter particles are operating at different rates so you mentioned before that the stats here aren't kind of watertight yet what kind of numbers are we talking about yeah very very hot water
yeah very very hot water tight throat after 6 years of this they want they thought they be able to see 24 electron neutrinos and seven election Anthony chinos and that's just because auntie mattress hard to produce them to text I didn't see that they sought 32 matter neutrinos and four
rinos and for Anthony Trollope so you know maybe if you flip a coin it comes up with slightly more heads and tails does that mean the coin is biased so they obviously need more data so what do we do doing just wait another couple of decades will buy 2021 when this extensions going to end of time
26 baffins going to end up coming my little have five times more data but it needs 13 times more data to get statistical confidence to what you would call 3 sigma and measure of of how unlikely results have to be due to chance an even that wouldn't be what forces would call a proof in the sort of Higgs particle sense that's just
Higgs particle sense that's just kind of reasonable but not completely convincing evidence for what they're going to do with that can I combine their data with an American experiment that sending a neutrino beam about 100 kilometres from fermilab to a mine in northern Minnesota and those two together could reach 3 sigma by around 20:20
sigma by around 20:20 now to get to the level you can say we found this out 5 so, you have to wait for a new generation of Neutrino experiments which are already being planned around the world but of course of it just becomes stronger over the next few years that's going to be exciting so let's move on from those tiny statsd
from those tiny starts to another set of actually quite impressive Liam this case small numbers Cuba has managed to stay relatively zika free compared to a lot of its neighbours are the zika virus has spread through the Americas and the Caribbean a small island of Puerto Rico has
Elena Puerto Rico has well over 1500 cases but cheaper this large Island as of 11th of August the only had three people who are infected by local mosquitoes somehow it's it's really managed to be the last in the Caribbean to succumb to local transmission of zika being spread by mosque
transmission of zika being spread by mosquitoes and we visited Cuba to find out how they done this effectively it's down to some very impressive healthcare public health and surveillance programs that was set up 35 years ago very fast writers of course to try and stop instruction of lots of
and stop instruction of lots of Vector Borne diseases so what kind of measures do they actually have in place will this all stars in 1981 when I saw the first outbreak of hemorrhagic dengue in the America's with Mum 344000 factions and they basically turn that into an opportunity they said of a national reporting system a framework for
reporting system a framework for cooperation between agencies education campaigns to encourage spraying self-monitoring for mosquito bites and a heavy fine for people who are found to have mosquitoes breeding on their property so it's eliminate mosquitoes at all costs and effectively with clouds of fumigants pesticide
perfume against pesticide which they are spraying around neighborhood sun and houses is this a model that other countries would be able to copy well we talk to the head of the Cuba office at the pan American Health Organisation about most and he said it's probably unrealistic for other countries to copy this monkey's control program which in
Monkeys control program which involves 9000 soldiers spraying homes killing mosquito larvae screen vs airport it's one of the best Healthcare networks in the developing world and it's government been stable for decades that's insured policy continuity and enforcement of those fine and the most important aspect
and most important aspects of a response by any country are increased surveillance and collaboration between government sectors now that we have seen new infections arising in Cuba does that mean they're never to be going to be more infections or will ramping up efforts be able to keep that under control there's inevitably going to be more
is inevitably going to be more infections but it seems like Cuba has as good a chance of any country of of keeping the Outbreak under control Richard thanks look for joining us for more on those stories and for all the latest science News head over to make sure. Come forward slash news on Twitter
