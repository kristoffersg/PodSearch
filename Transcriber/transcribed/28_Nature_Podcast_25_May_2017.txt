nature hello and welcome to the nature podcast science and art come together this week as engineers programme E coli to see in colour and use it to pink pictures three papers published together trace the spread of zika virus
trace the spread of zika virus across the Americas and take to get microscopic medical bits out of the lab and into your body this is the nature podcast for may 25th 2017 I'm Chamonix bundle and I'm Adam leave it
first Carrie is here with the story about a super villain and the band of scientists trying to track it down the story starts around 20:13
danced around 2013 super villain is zika virus and it was always one step ahead like a kind of public consciousness relatively this is from the Broad Institute
Ben McInnes from the Broad Institute in Cambridge Massachusetts to learn the virus and how it spread a long history it was first detected in the late 1940s in Africa but recently all that have been
but recently all that have been seen if it were a few cases in Asia on some islands in the Pacific that was before it rained its head in Brazil is Nicola sloman and infectious disease specialist at the University of Birmingham in the UK the ruling what were trying to do was fill in the gaps between what was going on in Asia
what was going on in Asia and how we how we end up where we are now taking everyone by surprise and there were plenty of reasons that it was a fearful foe
seekers claim difficult particularly customers many cases are asymptomatic very hard to detect weather going to clear this is Ezekiel looking at or another viruses transmitted by mosquitoes
and symptoms and complications re re saying and then questions about the evolution of the zika virus is it spreads the scientists have their work cut out but they also have secret weapons they can sequence pisica genomes fingerprints of the virus left behind in some
virus left behind in samples from patients and mosquitoes infected to them and try and understand how the virus is evolved also going to need to go and get the samples especially from regions in the northeast
Ashley from regions in the Northeast of Brazil this is the region where they suspected the Outbreak began and where the strongest link emerge between zika infection in pregnant women and their babies being born with abnormally small heads a condition called microcephaly to travel around the affected regions looking for zika in samples one group of scientists kitted out
hungry for scientists kitted out of vehicle befitting a team of superheroes a caravan being towed by a Jeep Top Gear style road trip Top Gear Tunbridge is a BBC TV show about cars who's host often do driving related trips and challenges Nicholas Lomond and
Rangers Nicholas Lomond and his team work long days driving the mobile lab between regional labs in northeast Brazil coming through samples for viruses and generating sequences to see how they were related they used every minute of the trip to do it says project leader Luis Alcantara is based at the field crews Research Institute in North East
Research Institute in northeast Brazil
the team release date for online as soon as I can collect it and posted preprints of their work their data plus the work from two other groups including bronwyn's as you did the earliest zika sequence yet found in Brazil from February 2014 overall the results published in three papers in nature and one in nature protocols
nature and one in nature protocols give the clearest picture yet about zika in merged split into several images of different clusters and but you know that the ancestor of these classes all seem to be from the northeast Brazil and as far back as
Brazil and as far back as as early as 2014 so will probably introduced into northeast Brazil and circulating northeast Brazil for a full year before it was the first detected from North East Brazil it to other parts of the country before finding it's way across the Americas to the Caribbean and from there at least
Caribbean and from there at least 4 separate times to the US to Florida
surveillance systems could have been able to pick this up at the end of most superhero stories the villain is crashed never to be seen again but in the end is a little more complicated this is the real world after all
the real world after all Bronwyn says that the data will help pinpoint where any new hot spots of zika come from and which sequences they relate to that could inform when to screen people arriving from particular countries for example other colleagues sequencing genomes from the ongoing yellow fever outbreak in Brazil to keep an eye on how it's being transmitted
can I on how it's being transmitted and help public health officials keep a lid on the Outbreak meanwhile the mobile lab is on the move this week Luis and the team of starting the second leg of their project covering the Amazon they plan to take the kids to the central east and South of Brazil in the coming year and it's good news for the Passengers the bus
news for the Passengers the bus has had an upgrade that was Luis Alcantara and you also heard from Nick learning and Bronwyn McInnes there are three papers that trace the zika Outbreak in nature this week find them all and
nature this week final at nature.com / nature and a news and views by Michael werribee you heard from before on the show in the same place later on in the news chat experimental ebola Vaccines may be used to tackle the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo right now he's back again with the research highlights
back again the research highlights one way of controlling diseases or pests is the handicapped them with harmful mutations but the Natural World has a way around that's according to a study of crop pest called the red flour beetle researches testing whether the Beatles
researchers testing whether the Beatles could invade the effects of an inserted mutation known as a gene drive with their own naturally occurring genetic variation many wild beetle groups had mutations that made them immune to Gene drives targeting three different genes previous work from the same team suggest a similar effect in mosquitoes
similar effect in mosquitoes the paper is in science advances sticky Feet of geckos have inspired scientists to make adhesive but it's hard to get them working on 3D surfaces or delicate Objects a team of material scientists spread tiny stretchy hairs across a flexible membrane
flexible membrane and attached to a solid disc the gadget has a tube attachment which can change the pressure on the membrane when they lower the pressure the membrane got sticky allowing them to position the device on an object and then grab it they suspended coffee cups cherry tomatoes and a plastic bag
and a plastic bag just your regular lab bench debris more in the journal pnas Christopher boy spends his time playing with bacteria so don't lots of biologist but Christopher's career path didn't start like most of those with
didn't start like most of bears with lectures on Darwin and DNA and practicals involving fruit flies well I actually haven't taken a class in biology so I not a single correctly now that's it yeah I'm told them but I was interested in computer science when I was in high school and I did a lot
and high school and I did a lot of programming and I decided in chemical engineering to apply it to problems in the physical Sciences into me using biology as a programming substrate about as hard as It Gets in so I took it on it challenge Christopher is interested in programming living organisms to do all
in living organisms to do all sorts of things this week he's got a paper out in nature chemical Biology which describes how bacteria can be genetically engineered to see in colour and capture images I asked him how common it is to engineer bacteria to respond to light there's been a lot of work too
there's been a lot of work to be able to get cells to be able to respond to light build a decade ago we will bacteria that are able to respond to one colour of light we had a red light sensor and connected it to an enzyme that when they're in time is expressed it then turns that
crested then turns the dish black to have a petri dish on which we spread the bacteria in so you could take a black and white image shine is on the plate and then it would record that image it's very stable I still have that doesn't have them in my office how do you have them up on the wall idea have you got pictures of you
have you got pictures of your family but you've done or anything like that I think my family but we have Super Mario so you printed these pictures back in 2005 by shining an image onto a plate of these light sensitive bacteria that light Trigger's than to make pigment and so they gradually build up the picture
Annie build up the picture a bit like her photograph but now you've taken it a step further by inserting three light receptors into the bacteria 14 red green and blue light and then you're using both sensors to control production of red green and blue pigments so now up later
so now a plate of these genetically modified bacteria can make colour pictures that's really what we've done here is combined different light sensitive respond to different colours that allow you then to shiner colour image itself and be able to control different genes with the different wavelengths
jeans with the different wavelengths so that seems like in some ways to next logical step but presumably it's been quite tricky it's taking you over 10 years to get to that stage where we haven't been working the entire time on this project with a did require a lot of the day answers to make it even possible as you increase the
as you increase the complexity of what you're trying to get a cell to do if he comes exponentially harder to put all the pieces together health and work in concert and have the so be happy when you put the DNA in it sounds like a really fun thing it sounds like a really neat thing to be able to create the Zuma
anything to be able to create these almost photographs but presumably there's some motivation for it be on just a look it's nice we can create these pictures are part of the motivation was to be able to control Gene expression remotely in quickly and so for example of Fear
so for example if you're looking at the production of the chemical in Fermanagh for example if it's in a million litres per minute then it becomes technically difficult to turn genes on and off at different times when they're needed it so with this will allow you to do is use different colours of light to in real time
in real time change with the cells are doing without having to directly connect with the cells and so you can imagine having a big Fermanagh with all different colours of light flashing in its Whittaker disorder disco bacteria so here you can control the expression of different genes with three different colours of light would it be
colours of light would it be possible to go even further and have an even bigger Range of light receptors inserted into the bacteria certainly I think there is her bacteria in the house up to 50 lights on Thursday to respond all sorts of things but I think we'll be really trying to do with this is now
really trying to do with this is now scale up making Better photographs but the scale of genetic engineering ever just using this is her example of how to do that and so we envision the future where we can go from this design that we published to being able to design entire genomes where you have
protein Arms where you have something functions that are happening genetic circuitry that process the information from the census in many different pathways are being controlled so that you could create an organism that say make so much more complex material or chemical than you could do today and are you done with this
and are you done with this toy example now now that you can approve the concept is that good you can put the toy back on the shelf for them what things you want to do with them there lots more things to do even as a toy system so I'd love to start thinking about can we put it in the ability to respond
body to respond to particular patterns of library chord patterns of light you can really imagine all sorts of things to have the salt do and now it move it towards not just being able to see colour to see images but to start to perceive it as well that was Christopher Boyton find the pie
that was Christopher Lloyd find the paper and nature. Come forward slash and empire and an H. Comm Ford slash news there's also a new story written by our very own Adam Levine finding out about medical micro boats which basically tiny robots that could be designed to move around inside your body doing helpful
inside your body doing helpful medical things like in the cartoon the magic School Bus or the film fantastic voyage where the people shrink down to microscopic sized and have to swim around the blood and splash through stomach acid and white blood cells not really no ok how about the micro boats in big Hero
micro boats in big hero 6 or the Borg nanoprobes in Star Trek All the Drones of tiny robots that Prince Charles has a going to turn everything into Greg oh yeah oh that last one medical micro bots do have the potential to be pretty cool they could be you
pretty cool they could be used to carry drugs around or perform surgery or replace failing bodily functions but there's still plenty of work needed before they'll be ready to transport cancer drugs to tumours or clear clogged arteries a comment piece this week takes a look at the state of medical micro bot technology and so I said
what technology so I sat down with nature comment editor Joe Baker to find out more there are many groups around the world who are looking at building needs to have Micro Machines different types different ways of preparing them they need to overcome a lot of challenges about the environment within the body they can be about the size
I can be about the size of a cell so you managing them within the bloodstream they got to somehow kind of weave their way through so the moment the focus is on designing the basic structure how they work and how they propel themselves is quite a big issue with the various ways propel them so the first way is using chemistry
are you still using chemistry little chemical micro Motors and you can build in catalysts that then reacts when you put them in a liquid they can move quite quickly and quite well but they are very hard to control and they tend to use really toxic substances so chemical micro Motors is one option
micro Motors is one option with some challenges to overcome what what are the other types of another type is you can drive them if you make them out of metallic materials so you put something like iron and ironing them then you can drive them using magnetic field so you can steer them fairly precisely if you wanted to move in East
I sleep if you want me to move in a straight line from A to B but if you want to make get them to go to a blood vessel or something like that it's very hard to get them to move more naturally and that's where the third type of micro motor comes in which uses a biological means of propulsion you make a synthetic micro motor
and micro motor and then you can eat put a sperm cell and a bacterium then you can use it to Salou drive a little structure II buy any artificial components and naturally occurring logical because the physical micro Motors are any good at certain tasks and they're fairly they're little
NFL e a little bit clunky essentially what they can do at the moment where is obviously biology gives us in a wonderful things like bacteria and sperm which they can do a whole load of everything so they can swim naturally through the body they can actually perform sum of natural reactions so if you want to hurt
so if you want to fertilize an egg with a sperm all those reactions of things which the sperm can do so you can use the biological bits for the bits that do mechanical bits on break good after nice first so when you need some mechanical bits for something that the biology and very good at and one example was trying to help sperm
an example was trying to help sperm that can't move very well which is a big cause of infertility can you use a mechanical micro motor attached to the sperm to help with the propulsion being so you can give it basically give it to lift you know to the egg the authors of our piece of actually made this sort of metallic helix
metallic helix which they can drive magnetically to move the the sperm to the egg directly the comment piece mentions some current challenges that we have with micro Motors what what kind of things I can't be causing Santa's headaches so the moment everything is pretty much been done in the petri dish
match being done in the petri dish in a lab where you can look at it through a microscope and see what's going on and you can control things you can use big magnets you can do what you like but if you want to bring this into clinical settings then you need other tools you can't stick a human under an electron microscope so these authors are calling
today's horses are calling for better biomedical imaging cuz if we ever going to put a lot of very small very fast moving things in our body and want to see like whether they're working or not we need to be able to see what they're doing in that's not something that can't technology can can manage work and what kind of things might be able
what kind of things might be able to help with visualisations of Mike what's inside the body the authors highlight few techniques that look very promising they think combining different types of imaging techniques and taking the good bits from all of them is the way forward so for instance ultrasound if you can
ultrasound if you combine it with different forms of infrared imaging and optical imaging you can get both to love high contrast images and sensitivity and you can also get really good sharp images with good spatial resolution as well and it's not just imaging technology there are still a lot of other child
OG there are still a lot of other challenges with Microsoft technology as it stands currently when you finished using these things in the body then what do you do with them but the authors of the common pleas did seem quite optimistic about the sort of Speed with which this could develop I think the white balls in their their ideas and their experiments
ideas and their experiments about within the next decade we could have we could have some used for non-invasive therapeutic microwave yeah so I think I think they believe that if we we find a few nights specific cases where these technologies can be used so such as the assisted fertilisation then you can
station then you can really try and start to bring everything together he gives people the focus that was Joe Baker talking about the Comet PC edited that was written by Marianna Medina Sanchez and Oliver Schmidt and it can be found at nick.com slash news and I want some images of micro box including the sperm box mentioned in the peace
spambots mentioned in the peace time now for the latest news and Amy maximum is on the line from the nature San Francisco office Amy there's been an abola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo DRC what's the situation how many cases have there been reported
where is suspected cases that done for death but only two of these deaths have been confirmed as testing positive for a boiler in the reason why there's only two that are confirmed so far is that the symbols have to travel from this area where there is no roads it also the seller has to be taken by motorbike
taken by motorbike by foot to a health centre there and then transferred I suppose by car and a lot of unpaved roads the capital in Kinshasa in that's where they can be tested so so far only to have been confirmed and there is about 400 people who had contact with the people who are suspected of having a ball of that are being man
suspected of having a bully that are being monitored how much food does this incidence of ebola could spread more widely
maybe there's more we don't know about and they have burnt out themselves and that's just because people stay in their areas often because there is not a lot of roads so they've previously that spread like Wildfire nonetheless there's always a concern that it could spread and so people are taking it quite seriously and in this
I seriously and in this case part of that taking it seriously is plans to potentially use a vaccine to protect against spread
look pretty good in clinical trials and Ginny are so it looks really good even though it's not yet been approved by any regulatory agency wh0 put together working group and that working group in April recommended that is there is another a bullet outbreak this vaccine be promptly deployed as long as it was the same strain and indeed it is the same strain one Night case
when that case why not start giving out the vaccine as soon as possible what's what's stopping things progressing right now that's a great question so back to the rest of the area it's going to be very expensive and I require a lot of personalities in aphids to get
an hour then afterwards to get the vaccine to people it has to be kept it - 80 which is a really big deal on a tropical country so I'll have to go inside of a sort of freezers that steak on there is not like a constant source of electricity anywhere so we'll have to be inside portable freezers
portable freezers in a wooden helicopter is Mayday on the backs of motorbikes at its logistically really really hard to get there anything to give you a sense doctors without borders as of Friday still hasn't gone into the epicentre within the province in the north with the Outbreak was so they just agree it's going to be extra
so Majestic Way it's going to be extremely complicated now it seems like the world Health Organisation and Congress authorities and others are all and board to help this happen but it's not gonna be simple and Howard actually giving out the vaccine once it's in the correct location work can you give it to people who've already been it
give it to people who've already been exposed what were they were vaccinated buddy had contact with people who have a bowler and also the context of those people so called the Wren design surveyor
ring design so if they had already been infected it's too late most likely but the ideas if we know they had not then they're not be protected is the protection pretty universal is there still a chance that people might might catch about leaving after the vaccination last for
how long a vaccine lasts forever in the trial and Ginny nobody who got vaccinated got ebola but the checkpoint was 10 days after vaccinations so that doesn't answer how long the vaccine last for but it does say it does suggest pretty heavy that there is some great coverage at least soon after the vaccine
missed you in after the vaccine elsewhere in Chile actually there's been another experimental intervention that has been sparkling controversy now this isn't about disease what is this intervention looking to affect Foundation who has proposed
proposed to the Chilean government to revise to Lane fisheries by releasing iron into the Pacific Ocean and the idea is this iron with stimulate phytoplankton and I suppose that's what fish would eat well has this kind of idea ever been attempted before at least
and Sanders been at least 13 iron fertilisation experiment since 1990 but there's been some kind of worrying side effects that could possibly be due to Toxic algal Blooms so actually because of these experiments the UN Convention on biological diversity put a moratorium on all but the smallest
Brian and all but the smallest ocean fertilization project quite a while ago but this group still would hope to do it so how about you hoping to carry this out if there's been this moratorium because the plant experiment takes place insulating what is exempt from those rules and what are they actually hoping to learn for
hoping to learn from this experiment previous studies are very clear about possible benefits and drawbacks and so for that reason between government recommended that there should be input from Training Academy of science so they will be meeting to discuss this and look at the evidence and see if it should go for
and to see if it should go forward so why would scientists be concerned that this experiment might not be worth doing in the first place
does Annette Pacific place if parents are moving so the timing and the place of of the ironing put my shift overtime in the third of tell what came from where so even if it was having an effect it would be hard to really observe what that affect was exactly what where is scientists is that
scientists is that the foundation in 2012 had another for the position project that they carried out of the coast of British Columbia and now project the group does iron sulphide into the ocean and the year since Sciences haven't seen any evidence that the experiment worked do we know
I'm at work to do we know when this might happen if it were too so we don't know about when it will be approved but the idea Foundation hope that this happens as soon as 2018 and they were dumped 10 tonnes of iron particles off the coast thank you Amy I reporter based in San Francisco find all the latest science News over
